      question: 'How to calculate a fixed cost that is not paid monthly',
      answer: `
        <p>Include any fixed costs that are not incurred monthly into your calculations. These typically include certain startup and other one-time payments. <strong>Examples of these types of expenses include</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First month’s rent</li>
          <li>Security deposit</li>
          <li>Licenses and permits</li>
          <li>Legal fees</li>
          <li>Signage</li>
          <li>Technology and software</li>
        </ul>
      <p>To estimate monthly amounts for these payments, simply divide the cost amount by 12. For fixed costs incurred on a quarterly basis, divide the cost amount by four.</p>

      question: 'How to identify a fixed cost vs. a variable cost',
      answer: `
        <p>Fixed costs are expenses that typically stay the same each month, while variable costs increase or decrease based on a company's production volume. For example, utility costs incur monthly but are considered variable because they change in proportion to energy usage.</p>

    {
      question: 'Considerations for semi-variable costs',
      answer: `
        <p>Semi-variable costs comprise a mixture of both fixed and variable components. Costs are fixed for a set level of production or consumption and become variable after this production level is exceeded. For example, fixed expenses such as salaries might increase in proportion to production volume increases in the form of overtime pay.</p>

      question: 'How to calculate selling price per unit',
      answer: `
        <p>Run your business on gross margin (net income), not on revenues and sales. Dropping your prices to sell more will make it difficult in the long run to attract customers who will buy your product at full price. Aim for more profitable sales, not just more sales.</p>
        <p>Factor value into your pricing, too. Value correlates to the reason why customers buy from you and not from others. With that in mind, consider these three benchmarks when pricing per unit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cost-plus pricing</strong>: Factor in direct expenses per unit plus a percentage above the cost of goods.</li>
          <li><a href='https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/market-research-competitive-analysis#section-header-2'>Competitive analysis</a>: Be aware of what your competitors charge and the value of what they deliver.</li>
          <li><strong>Value proposition</strong>: Develop a brand that supports your ability to charge the highest price possible.</li>

      question: 'Accounting for multiple products and services',
      answer: `
        <p>Most businesses offer more than just one product or service, and there are different ways of accounting for the multiple products and services you offer. This break-even analysis is based on the foundation of a single product or service. Here are some pricing approaches to consider:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Versioning</strong>: Create different versions of a product to encourage consumers to self-select into groups that pay different prices. This approach, popular with cell phone manufacturers, can potentially grow the size of the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-product pricing</strong>: If you offer a portfolio of “good/better/best” products and services, aim to ensure the number of customers paying higher prices outweigh the number of customers who choose lower-priced products and services.</li>

      question: 'How to predict unit sales',
      answer: `
        <p>Predicting unit sales, also known as sales forecasting, is less about accuracy and more about effective business management. Good forecasting helps you make the connection between sales, costs, and expenses by tracking your business numbers back to key drivers you need to manage such as web traffic, inventory levels, and returns.</p>
        <p>Predicting unit sales helps you compare expectations with actual outcomes so you can make change. Make good educated guesses and implement forecasting early on so that adjustments can be made sooner rather than later.</p>

      question: 'Accounting for multiple products and services',
      answer: `
        <p>Break out products and services into factors that are easy to track. To make it manageable, identify no more than five major categories. For example, if you run a bookstore, your categories might be paperbacks, hard covers, and magazines.</p>
        <p>Try to organize your sales forecast the same way that your accounting or bookkeeping tracks each category of sales.</p>`

      question: 'Qualifications for variable costs',
      answer: `
        <p>Sometimes it can be difficult to determine which costs are variable. For instance, a full-time employee’s salary will be fixed, but the cost of a temporary or seasonal worker would be considered variable. Keep in mind that your variable costs might also change with discounts or opportunity sales.</p>
